					<h2 class="">Story Mapping?</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					Because flat backlogs are terrible at communicating the <strong>big pictures</strong> or <strong>systems</strong>.
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Flat backlogs are great at communicating a detailed view of what will be completed at the end of the sprint. But it doesn't help us communicate or visualize how that sprint fits or adds to the over all systems or software we are building.</p>
						<p>It's a big pile of context free stuff the SOMEBODY is making us build. With flat backlogs we can see how a user gets from point A to point B but it is impossible to see they get from point A to point Z.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					It's a <strong>better</strong> way to build <strong>backlogs</strong>.
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Creating feature after feature and adding it to a backlog is a great way to become a feature factory. Mindlessly adding complexity to a system without any real understand of why and how it beneifits the end user.</p>
						<p>It help us see how to gradulally build up the systems and only focus on the current and next MVP while at the same time seeing the big picture.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					Also because written requirements alone are a <strong>terrible</strong> way to build <strong>ANYTHING</strong>!

					Don't believe <strong>ME</strong>?

						<p>CakeWreak.com is a simplified example how written requirements with proper context and conversations can produce horrible outcomes for everybody involved.</p>

					Write this on the cake. <br>Happy 40<sup style="font-size:50%;">th</sup> Birthday Kim!

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>How many times have you been in a conversersation somebody wrote something down for someelse to follow and it was not what the writer wanted.</p>
						<p>What was missing was context. That can only correctlly be transferred and understood through a conversation.</p>

					<h4>The book!</h4>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>User story mapping is a valuable tool for software development, once you understand why and how to use it. This insightful book examines how this often misunderstood technique can help your team stay focused on users and their needs without getting lost in the enthusiasm for individual product features.

						<p>Author Jeff Patton shows you how changeable story maps enable your team to hold better conversations about the project throughout the development process. Your team will learn to come away with a shared understanding of what you’re attempting to build and why.</p>
