# Story Mapping

## What is *Story Mapping*?

A user story map arranges user stories into a useful model to help understand the functionality of the system, identify holes and omissions in your backlog, and effectively plan holistic releases that deliver value to users and business with each release *(from Jeff Patton's The New User Story Backlog Is a Map)*.
